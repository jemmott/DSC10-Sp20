Compute three values: the result of Alice's roll (`roll_result`), the result of her roll plus Roga's modifier (`modified_result`), and a boolean value indicating whether the action succeeded (`action_succeeded`).  **Do not fill in any of the results manually**; the entire simulation should happen in code.\n",
