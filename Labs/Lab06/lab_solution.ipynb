Then she had extend their hands through a screen so they could not see her. On the other side of the screen, Emily would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to correctly answer which hand Emily put out. Overall, in 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
