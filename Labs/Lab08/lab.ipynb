    "Welcome to Lab 8! This lab is due **Thursday 5/21 at 11:59pm**. In this lab you will practice calculating variance, calculating standard deviation, and converting values to standard units. You will use these skills to compare grades in a course and you will use Chebyshev’s bounds to predict how hard the students should work in order to rank in the top 5% of the class. Finally, you will use confidence intervals to help college administrators plan for next quarter by predicting the enrollment in a new course.\n",
